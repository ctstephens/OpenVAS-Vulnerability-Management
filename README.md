### Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner OpenVAS
<![OpenVAS Install](https://github.com/ctstephens/OpenVAS-Vulnerability-Management/assets/150542854/aff0cfaf-1e19-41a5-8238-b7492d7d757e)>

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to the Marketplace and search for "OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED"
3. Choose the "Start with a pre-set configuration" option and select the weakest configuration.
4. Click "Continue to Create VM"
5. Configure the VM:
   - Resource Group: Vulnerability-Management
   - VM Name: OpenVAS (Take note of the region and Vnet–consider East US 2)
   - Authentication: Username → azureuser / Cyberlab123!
   - Monitoring: Disable Boot Diagnostic
6. Click "Create" to create the VM.
7. Once the VM is created, SSH into it using PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) with the provided credentials.

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Search for Virtual Machines and create a new Virtual Machine.
3. Configure the VM:
   - Resource Group: Vulnerability-Management
   - VM Name: Win10-Vulnerable
   - Region: Same as the OpenVAS VM (East US 2)
   - Virtual Network: Same as OpenVAS
   - Image: Windows 10 Pro
   - Size: Any size with 2 vCPUs
   - Username: azureuser / Cyberlab123!
   - Networking: Same Vnet as OpenVAS
4. Create the VM.
5. Once the VM is created, ensure you can RDP into it with the provided credentials.
6. After logging in, make the VM vulnerable:
   - Disable the Windows Firewall
   - Gather up some [Old Software](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n83ilCjZWZulbDdYnUe9wQPK2buY47_U?usp=sharing)
   - Install an Old Version of FireFox: Firefox Setup 97.0b5
   - Install an Old Version of VLC Player: vlc-1.1.7-win32
   - Install an Old Version of Adobe Reader: 10.0_AdbeRdr1000_en_US_1_
   - Restart the VM.

### Configure OpenVAS to Perform First Unauthenticated Scan against our Vulnerable VM
<![Scan Vuln VMs](https://github.com/ctstephens/OpenVAS-Vulnerability-Management/assets/150542854/f26913c1-8e1a-454f-ab38-bb3816830c97)>

1. Login to OpenVAS and navigate to Assets > Hosts > New Host.
2. Add the Client VM PRIVATE IP Address.
3. Create a New Target from the Host, name it "Azure Vulnerable VMs".
4. Take note of the credentials. We will add SMB credentials later.
5. Create a new Task:
   - Name & Comment: "Scan - Azure Vulnerable VMs"
   - Scan Targets: "Azure Vulnerable VMs"
6. Save the Task.
7. Start the "Scan - Azure Vulnerable VMs" Task.
8. Once the scan is finished, click the date under "Last Report" to see the results.
9. Take note of the Tabs, especially the "Results" tab.

### Make Configurations for Credentialed Scans (Within VM)
<![Win Config](https://github.com/ctstephens/OpenVAS-Vulnerability-Management/assets/150542854/4bb14c6b-6d3f-4903-9614-528d374d91a3)>

1. Disable Windows Firewall.
2. Disable User Account Control.

     - Name: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
     - Value: 1
   - Close Registry Editor.
5. Restart the VM.
